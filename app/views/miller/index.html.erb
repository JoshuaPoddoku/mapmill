<h1>MapMill: help map the oil spill</h1>
<h2>"Oil Spill Hot or Not": Help us sort images of the oil spill</h2>

<p><i>It takes hours to go through the thousands of images we're capturing <a href="http://grassrootsmapping.org/gulf-oil-spill">from balloons and kites</a>, to pick out the best ones for inclusion in our <a href="http://grassrootsmapping.org/gulf-oil-spill/#data">free and open source maps</a>. Help us by choosing the sharpest, clearest, best images.</i></p>

<h3 id="buttons">Is it <a class="green"  href="/miller/vote/?path=<%= @image.path %>&points=10"">really good</a>, <a class="yellow" href="/miller/vote/?path=<%= @image.path %>&points=5">just ok</a>, or <a href="/miller/vote/?path=<%= @image.path %>&points=0">trash</a>?</h3>
<p>We want images that are aimed straight down and are not blurry. We also want images of as large an area as possible. The rest are trash! If you're not sure, mark it OK</p>
